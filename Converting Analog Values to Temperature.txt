Converting Analog Values to Temperature

Above I mentioned that using the thermistor would be simple, and that's because we can stand on the shoulders of giants.  There is an equation to do the translation from sampled value to temperature called the Steinhart–Hart equation. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermistor)  The Steinhart-Hart equation has already been translated for the Arduino.  One examples of this can be found at playground.arduino.cc in an article by Milan Malesevic and Zoran Stupic.  I've illustrated their function Thermistor() below and added comments on how to use it.

#include <math.h>         //loads the more advanced math functions
 
void setup() {            //This function gets called when the Arduino starts
  Serial.begin(115200);   //This code sets up the Serial port at 115200 baud rate
}
 
double Thermister(int RawADC) {  //Function to perform the fancy math of the Steinhart-Hart equation
 double Temp;
 Temp = log(((10240000/RawADC) - 10000));
 Temp = 1 / (0.001129148 + (0.000234125 + (0.0000000876741 * Temp * Temp ))* Temp );
 Temp = Temp - 273.15;              // Convert Kelvin to Celsius
 Temp = (Temp * 9.0)/ 5.0 + 32.0; // Celsius to Fahrenheit - comment out this line if you need Celsius
 return Temp;
}
 
void loop() {             //This function loops while the arduino is powered
  int val;                //Create an integer variable
  double temp;            //Variable to hold a temperature value
  val=analogRead(0);      //Read the analog port 0 and store the value in val
  temp=Thermister(val);   //Runs the fancy math on the raw analog value
  Serial.println(temp);   //Print the value to the serial port
  delay(1000);            //Wait one second before we do it again
